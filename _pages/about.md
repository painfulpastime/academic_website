# Electrical Engineer | Systems Thinker
Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
I am an Electrical Engineering graduate passionate about blending technology, innovation, and impact.
I thrive at the intersection of energy, automation, and data science, solving real-world problems through creativity and applying sound engineering principles.

## What I Do 🚀

🔧Power Systems & Automation: Hands-on experience with PLC programming, control engineering, and renewable integration.

📊Data Analytics & Machine Learning: Forecasting electricity demand, modeling markets, and finding patterns that fuel better decisions.

🌱Energy Innovation Research: Exploring tomorrow’s energy solutions today.

👔Entrepreneurship & Consulting: Helping startups and businesses sharpen their operations and strategy.

## A Little More About Me 🎯

🎨When I’m not engineering solutions, you'll find me exploring systems theory, diving into finance & venture capital trends, playing a competitive game of chess, or kicking around a soccer ball.

I'm currently based in Mauritius, building cool things and giving back to a community that has given me so much. 🌍
